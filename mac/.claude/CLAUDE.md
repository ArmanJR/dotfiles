Notes:

- Do not create any instructions or markdown file (unless explicitly asked to).
- No clever tricks; choose the boring solution that perfectly works.
- If working with Python, prefer `uv` over `pip` or `venv`. 
- If creating a Python script, add inline script metadata for `uv` (only applies to single Python scripts and NOT to Python projects).
